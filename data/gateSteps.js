    0: `You are found, and lost, everywhere and nowhere, loved and hated,
    filled with pride and full of shame. There is nothing here.`,

    1: `You find yourself in your past. Before you the choice you made then.
    This moment defined a part of you, for better or for worse, it was important.
    you are a bystander here, you can't change your actions, your words from then.
    The people you hurt, those that hurt you. they are just that, people, some deserve their fates.
    others did nothing but cross your path. Did you make the right choice? what would be diffrent if you only
    hadn't did what you did, said what you said. Did this moment harden your heart? did it finally soften it?
    do you have a harder time looking at your past self here or what is reflected in the mirror in the present?`,

    2: `This is not a place, she is a soul, she is gentle, and she is weak. You can feel the faint beat of her heart.
    She recognizes you, and is happy that you've come. She opens her month to speak but sound doesn't travel in this place.
    Instead she smiles, her flame flickers, her time is soon, but it doesn't worry her. The only thing in her eyes is you.`,

    3: `You don't recognize this place, its not your past or present. It might your future, or maybe it's someone else's.
    There is people here, they move in frames, like a painting of life, it is odd.
    At the center you see a man, he is on his knees, you look at his face but you can't tell if its happiness or sadness that fills it.
    he doesn't move, completely still, the would moves around him, without him. You can feel the well of emotion within him, there is so much
    but it also is so little. He feels the world, and he feels nothing. You can tell he doesn't like to live like this. You don't understand what
    drives him to keep living like this. Somehow you know, he doesn't know either.`,

    4: `We are here together, you and me, we are one. I have lived with you've regreted most. I've seen you at your lowest, when you were
    in the dirt and covered in soot. I was there you commited the act we are most ashamed of, I've always been here you. Because I am you,
    we are broken, we have hurt and been hurt, we struggle. I am you, and I love you. I will never leave you, and you will never face anything alone.`
